"John 14:6 Jesus said unto him, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.<br>John 3:18 “He that believeth in Him is not condemned; but He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br>Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers,and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”<br>1 Corinthians 6:18 <br>Flee fornication. Every other sin which a man doeth is outside the body, but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.<br>Matthew 12:45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.”<br>Romans 8:6<br>6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace,<br>Luke 12:20<br>21st Century King James Version<br>20 But God said unto him, ‘Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee. Then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?’<br>1 Timothy 5:6<br>21st Century King James Version<br>6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.<br>1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<br>10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>1 John 2:17<br>21st Century King James Version<br>17 And the world passeth away and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<br>Matthew 22:29<br>29 Jesus answered and said unto them, “Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.<br>John 8:51<br>21st Century King James Version<br>51 Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep My saying, he shall never see death.”<br>2 John 9<br>21st Century King James Version<br>9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ hath both the Father and the Son.<br>Titus <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRpeEdMmmQ0&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a><br>21st Century King James Version<br>14 not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth.<br>2 Peter 3:18<br>21st Century King James Version<br>18 But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.<br>Romans 12:2<br>2 And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<br>Hebrews 9:24<br>21st Century King James Version<br>24 For Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.<br>Colossians 2:10<br>10 And ye are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power,<br>Deuteronomy 6<br>14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people who are round about you<br>2 Corinthians 11:14<br>14 And no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.  <br>Jeremiah 7:18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger.<br>1 Corinthians 10<br>20 But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.<br>1 Timothy 2<br>5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,<br>Deuteronomy 8<br>19 And it shall be, if thou at all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.<br><br>Deuteronomy 18:10 There shall not be found among you any one who maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or who useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, 11 or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.<br>Proverbs 7:27<br>21st Century King James Version<br>27 Her house is the way to hell, leading down to the chambers of death.<br><br>1 John 5<br>20 And we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is true; and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and Eternal Life.<br>Acts 17<br>29 “For inasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone, graven by art and of man’s devising.<br>Proverbs 14:12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>1 John 4<br>3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; and such is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even now already it is in the world.<br>2 John 1<br>9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ hath both the Father and the Son.<br>John 8<br>12 Then spoke Jesus again unto them, saying, “I am the Light of the world. He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”<br>Mark 8<br>35 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for My sake and the Gospel’s, the same shall save it.<br>John 8<br>51 Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep My saying, he shall never see death.”<br>John 17<br>3 And this is life eternal: that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.<br>1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,<br>Acts 4<br>12 Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.”<br>James 1<br>21 Therefore lay apart all filthiness and the superfluity of wickedness, and receive with meekness the engrafted Word, which is able to save your souls.<br>John 11<br>25 Jesus said unto her, “I am the resurrection and the Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;<br>26 and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?”<br>John 6<br>68 Then Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life,<br>Psalm 119<br>30 I have chosen the way of truth; Thy judgments have I laid before me.<br>Psalm 119<br>11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.<br>Romans 12<br>2 And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<br>1 Corinthians 2:5 that your faith should not stand on the wisdom of man, but on the power of God.<br><br>1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.<br>1 John 2<br>16 For all that is in the world — the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life — is not of the Father, but is of the world.<br>17 And the world passeth away and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<br>James 1<br>21 Therefore lay apart all filthiness and the superfluity of wickedness, and receive with meekness the engrafted Word, which is able to save your souls.<br>1 Corinthians 15<br>44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.<br>1 Thessalonians 5<br>9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ<br>John 3<br>18 “He that believeth in Him is not condemned; but He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br>John 3<br>36 He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.”<br>Luke 6:5<br>21st Century King James Version<br>5 And He said unto them, “The Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”<br>Matthew 22<br>29 Jesus answered and said unto them, “Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.<br>John 5:29<br>21st Century King James Version<br>29 and shall come forth — they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.<br>John 8<br>12 Then spoke Jesus again unto them, saying, “I am the Light of the world. He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”<br>John 8:32<br>21st Century King James Version<br>32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”<br>John 6<br>40 And this is the will of Him that sent Me: that every one who seeth the Son and believeth in Him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the Last Day.”<br>Mark 13:13<br>21st Century King James Version<br>13 And ye shall be hated by all men for My name’s sake; but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<br>Revelation 14:12<br>21st Century King James Version<br>12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.<br>John 8<br>36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<br>Mark 13<br>31 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.",0.9985,Positive
